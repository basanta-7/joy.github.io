                    I know I'm not the most romantic person ever, neither am I good at expressing feelings. But I have fallen so hard for you,  
                    I wanted to write something to you, no matter how bad or cringe it might be. Joy you make me so so happy, every time I see you 
                    my heart goes brrrrrr...... You are the love of my life Joy. You are the most amazing person I have ever met and I'm so 
                    glad to call you mine. We had so many amazing moments, so many memories together and I wanna revisit some of them and I promise to 
                    create even more in the future.
